  <h2>Self-knowing AI</h2>
  Self-knowing AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that have a level of self-awareness or self-knowledge. This can be achieved by implementing inner speech in robots, allowing them to develop a sense of self and interact better with humans. The opportunities for self-knowing AI include improved communication, decision-making, learning abilities, and more advanced human-robot interactions. Self-knowing AI has the potential to lead to significant advances in fields such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science. However, it also poses challenges such as the need for new cognitive architectures and defining and measuring self-awareness.
